# python-text-calculator

###### NOTE: python-text-calculator:notPalc is officially discontinued. This is an outdated version of Palc, and probably contains some bugs. Just, don't.

This is a Python script I forked when I wanted to learn math in Python.

Learning this is very interesting. 

I always make my forked repositories better
