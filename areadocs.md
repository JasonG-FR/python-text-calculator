`area.py` is currently not too user-friendly.

While I work on making it interactive (only on my local machine), here is the documentation.

This page will stay on the wiki even after it is made interactive, for archival purposes.

## Equilateral triangle
Syntax: `equtri_area(<side_of_triangle>)`, replacing <side_of_triangle> with the length of the side of the triangle.

## Triangle with right angle
Syntax: `righttri_area(<base_of_triangle>, <height_of_triangle>)`, replacing <base_of_triangle> and <height_of_triangle> with the appropriate measurements.

## Acute triangle
Syntax: `acute_triangle_area(<length_of_side>, <length_of_side_2>, <length_of_side_3>)`, replacing <length_of_side> and the others with the proper measurements.

## Obtuse Triangle
Syntax: `obtuse_triangle_area(<length_of_side>, <length_of_side_2>, <length_of_side_3>)`, replacing <placeholders> with the correct numbers.

## Square
Syntax: `square_area(<side>)`, replacing <side> with the length of the side.

## Rectangle
Syntax: `rectangle_area(<base>, <height>)`, adding the proper numbers.

## Parallelogram
Syntax: `parallelogram_area(<base>, <height>)`, adding the measurements.

## Rhombus
Syntax: `rhombus_area(do, ds)`, replacing do with the first diagonal and ds with the second diagonal

## Trapezium
Syntax: `trapezium_area(a, b, h)`, replacing `a` and `b` with the parallel sides, and `h` as the height.

## Full circle
Syntax: `circle_area(r)`, replacing `r` with the radius of the circle

## Semicircle
Syntax: `semicircle_area(r)`, replacing `r` with the radius of the circle

## Circular sector
I cannot figure out what `a` is for, line 182 in `area.py` if anyone wants to help

## Ring
Syntax: `cirring_area(ro, rs)`, replacing `ro` with the radius of the outer circle and `rs` with the radius of the inner circle

## Ellipse
Syntax: `ellipse_area(a, b)`, replacing `a` and `b` with the length of major and minor axis, respectively
