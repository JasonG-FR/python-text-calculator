# Here are the known issues for Palc

- It is impossible to run area.py or volume.py from palc.py
- The reason I havent made a release in a bit is because there is an error in compilation. Do not use git clone to download the program unless you are planning on helping.
- Speaking of which, helping would be great! Help squash these bugs.
